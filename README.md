This is the source code of a demo that I prepared for the talk "Gaining lateral movement in cloud solutions by leveraging bad API impersonation designs", delivered at NULL Hyderabad security meetup.
In a nutshell, this demo is an approximation of [Facebook's View As vulnerability](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/)
More details about this demo are on [this blog post](https://blog.novogeek.com/perils-of-bad-api-impersonation-design/)

Note: The demo was purposefully built with several identity-related design & implementation vulnerabilities, and basic webapp-related security controls were ignored. Please do not take it as an implementation reference for your production systems!
